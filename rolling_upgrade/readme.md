# Demo for a Rolling Upgrade from Elasticsearch 6.x to 7.x

* Start the cluster in version 6.x with `docker-compose up`.

```js
GET /

GET _cat/nodes?h=id,version,master,name&v

GET _cluster/health

POST test/_doc
{
  "name": "Elasticsearch 6.7"
}

# Check the upgrade assistant

# Do not set to none since Kibana wants to create indices when starting up with 7
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "transient": {
    "cluster.routing.allocation.enable": "new_primaries"
  }
}

POST _flush/synced

# Change .env and switch the commented and uncommented sections
# docker-compose up -d --no-deps elasticsearch3

GET _cat/nodes?h=id,version,master,name&v
