# Docker & Elastic

This repository contains a few examples how to run Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash in Docker using the official images and binding them to the default ports. Tested with the latest version of the Docker daemon.

The credentials are always `elastic` and `changeme` when you connect to Kibana ([http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)) or Elasticsearch ([http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)).


## Minimal Elasticsearch + Kibana

* Start: `$ docker-compose -f elasticsearch-kibana-minimal.yml up`
* Remove: `$ docker-compose -f elasticsearch-kibana-minimal.yml down`


## Elasticsearch & Kibana

* Start: `$ docker-compose -f elasticsearch-kibana.yml up`
* Remove: `$ docker-compose -f elasticsearch-kibana.yml down`


## Full Stack

Change into the directory *./full_stack/*.
This includes Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, nginx, and MySQL and monitors all components with the Elastic Stack.

**Note:** You will need to increase the memory for all the containers to function correctly. Tested with 4GB instead of the default of 2GB.

* Start: `$ docker-compose up`
* Remove: `$ docker-compose down`


## Machine Learning

Change into the directory *./machine_learning/*.
This includes Elasticsearch and Kibana as well as setting up the index patterns and dashboards for Filebeat. It doesn't import any data automatically â€” this is up to you.

**Note:** For the ease of use security is disabled here.

* Start: `$ docker-compose up`
* Remove: `$ docker-compose down`
